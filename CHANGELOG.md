## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.21] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Deferred MCP tool schemas behind compact server summaries and `tool_search`, loading only the tools relevant to the current session.
- Made context-limit failures provider-independent and report the request and endpoint token limits when available.
- Persisted Linux release-runner APT, Cargo, cargo-xwin, Windows SDK, and cross-target caches with explicit cache identity and validation.

### Fixed

- Made session and configuration replacement atomic and ordered across Linux and Windows, and waited for the final save before reporting a resumable exit.
- Made Escape interrupt routing, turn preparation, model requests, and completion races immediately, including when a draft is present or a permission request finishes concurrently.
- Excluded `.cawki` and `.caw-agent` runtime trees from checkpoint Git baselines, preventing recursive checkpoint growth and long uninterruptible scans.
- Avoided retrying deterministic streaming rejections with the same non-stream request.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Added visible MCP pack installation phases, duplicate-operation protection, and a persistent custom-source action in the MCP catalog.
- Made MCP dependency installation explicit and on demand instead of silently installing every package's Python requirements.
- Staged and validated MCP pack updates before activation, preserving the previous version when installation or registration fails.
- Restricted automatic bridge setup to official Hub packs and documented which external dependencies and application add-ons remain after uninstall.

### Fixed

- Prevented MCP installs from appearing permanently stuck during hidden dependency setup and bounded official bridge setup with a hard timeout.
- Surfaced post-install warnings in the MCP menu and cleaned temporary download, extraction, and staging directories after failures.

## [0.1.19] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Published the complete Cawki distribution under the `cawki` command, package, release-asset, data-directory, and Hub names.
- Serialized Windows ARM64 SDK downloads and added visible heartbeats, hard timeouts, and cache-preserving retries for the China-hosted release runner.

## [0.1.18] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Renamed the product, Cargo package, executable, release assets, commands, and local data directories to `cawki` without a legacy compatibility layer.
- Rebranded the public website, documentation, installers, MCP packs, and release workflows as Cawki and moved their repository references to `noxrick91/cawki-hub`.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Redesigned the Router menu with Provider and Model pickers for Fast, Default, Strong, and the dedicated classifier model.
- Made Router escalation gradual from Fast to Default to Strong, with working controls for stall and verification-failure escalation.
- Expanded Router decision feedback with classification source, score, confidence, fallback, vision requirements, and routing reasons.
- Clarified when Hybrid and LLM classification can add an extra model request and cost.

### Fixed

- Kept the selected Welcome theme visible when the terminal is too short to show the complete theme list.
- Prevented selecting a Router tier from silently clearing its configured model.
- Warned when a visual request falls back to a model that is not vision-capable.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added keyboard selection and detail opening to the Todo list, matching the Agents panel controls.
- Added Plan-style Todo detail sheets with Markdown tables, code blocks, and Mermaid diagrams.

### Fixed

- Reduced intermittent UI stalls during active tasks by making periodic persistence non-blocking and consolidating recovery snapshots.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- Fixed `upgrade now` rejecting GitHub releases whose optional notes field is `null`.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Improved the contrast of compact header, status, and footer text.
- Presented LLM failures as a distinct error block instead of inline transcript text.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale characters appearing around ambiguous-width punctuation in Chinese Windows Terminal sessions.
- Fixed Windows workspace paths showing Unix separators or leaking the `\\?\` verbatim prefix.
- Kept bottom chrome above ConPTY's partially visible resize row so footer text is not clipped.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Added native Windows ARM64 release builds, installers, self-upgrades, and website downloads alongside Linux x86_64/ARM64 and Windows x86_64.
- Removed unavailable macOS binaries from the public download matrix while retaining source-level macOS support.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Hardened built-in MCP services with workspace-confined paths, dependency allowlists, and framing-safe stdout handling.
- Added separate prompt-cache write token and pricing accounting.
- Added self-hosted Forgejo release builds for Linux x86_64, Linux ARM64, and Windows x86_64 GNU; macOS prebuilt packages are temporarily unavailable.

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic prompt totals, cache-hit percentages, cache-write accounting, context compaction thresholds, and cost estimates.
- Fixed document, image, OCR, and speech MCP smoke tests hanging on Content-Length framing.
- Fixed FreeCAD and Blender status calls failing when their desktop backends are not installed.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Improved terminal image previews with full half-block color detail and theme-aware transparent backgrounds.
- Hardened Unix and Windows installers with executable/version verification, strict checksum matching, and automatic rollback.

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows commands that used unavailable `head` or `tail` utilities, including commands inside shell pipelines.
- Fixed the unpainted Windows terminal safety column that could leave a missing background patch at the lower-right edge.
- Fixed completed projects occasionally reopening the Welcome setup after restart or console-window close.
- Fixed model API keys entered for a non-active provider being dispatched as chat messages instead of saved securely.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Added Tab-cycled keyboard focus so the composer, tasks, and agents panels can be navigated without fighting the input caret.
- Improved file downloads with live byte and percentage progress.
- Improved install and upgrade guidance: Linux sudo is requested in another terminal, PATH conflicts are explained, and Windows replaces the locked executable after exit.

### Fixed

- Fixed failed background tasks leaving the parent idle instead of recovering.
- Fixed transcript scrolling so code and diagram headers no longer stay pinned while the body moves.
- Fixed markdown tables overflowing a narrow terminal.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-18
