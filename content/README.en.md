# Cawki user guide

Cawki is a coding partner that lives in your terminal. It reads code, edits files, and runs tests in the current workspace. File tools stay in the workspace by default; writes and commands ask by default, and permissions can be tightened or relaxed per project. The UI provides a permission broker, sandbox, MCP, sessions, and memory.

Prebuilt binaries install from this site’s [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/noxrick91/cawki-hub/releases) into `~/.cawki/bin`. The source repo is private.

### What it does

- Keeps file tools in the workspace by default; every read, edit, and run shows up in the terminal
- Asks before writing files or running commands; you can tighten or loosen permissions per project
- Remembers project habits across sessions; MCP servers and skills plug in when you need them
- Works with official APIs, local Ollama, and third-party OpenAI-compatible gateways

### Where models come from

Official providers are `/model add <preset>` — `openai`, `anthropic`, `deepseek`, `qwen`, and the others in the menu. Local models are `/model add ollama`; no cloud key.

Relays (NewAPI, OneAPI, and other “OpenAI-compatible” hosts) should **not** overwrite an official preset URL. Add a separate named provider with the gateway’s base URL, key, and model id. See [Models and keys](#/models).

### How to read this guide

Start with [Install](#/install) and [Quick start](#/quick-start). Slash commands, permissions, sessions, and MCP come later. The **中文 / EN** control switches the whole manual and keeps you on the same page.

## What's new

This page lists changes in the **current public release**.

**What's new in v0.2.0** — 2026-09-03

- `cawki serve` now requires a token on loopback as well. Existing automation that called the API with no `Authorization` header receives 401. Pass `--token` / `CAW_SERVE_TOKEN`, read the token printed at startup, or opt out with `--anonymous`.
- Remembered MCP approvals are now keyed on the individual tool rather than the whole server, so grants saved by earlier versions no longer match and each MCP tool asks once more.
- `--allowedTools` no longer overrides plan mode. Writes, shell, MCP, and network stay denied in plan regardless of the flag.
- The Blender and FreeCAD GUI bridges require the token their addon writes at startup. Reinstall the addon (`python mcp/<app>/install_bridge.py`) and restart the application; `*_BRIDGE_HOST` is no longer read.
- Required a per-machine token on the Blender and FreeCAD GUI bridges, which run arbitrary Python inside those applications. The addon writes the token to `~/.cawki/<app>-bridge.json` (owner-only) on startup, the port is loopback-only and no longer configurable, and a connection whose first line is not JSON is dropped so a web page cannot reach the bridge with a cross-origin request.
- Required an `Authorization: Bearer` token for `cawki serve` on loopback as well; without `--token` a random one is generated and printed at startup, and `--anonymous` is now the explicit way to serve without auth.
- Stopped `cawki serve` from silently widening the permission mode: an HTTP caller now gets the mode the user configured instead of being upgraded to `auto`.
- Rejected session ids that are not a single path segment. A crafted id could previously read, and through `serve` also write, JSON files outside the sessions directory.
- Narrowed MCP approvals from the whole server to the individual tool named on the approval sheet. A server-wide grant is still available as an explicit `mcp:<server>__*` pattern.
- Stopped auto mode from approving arbitrary scripts whose filename merely contains `pytest` or `unittest`, and required every `mvn` / `gradle` goal to be a verify goal.
- Stopped `--allowedTools` from overriding plan mode. Plan can be entered at any moment with Shift+Tab and the model is told it cannot touch the codebase, so a launch flag no longer quietly re-enables writes, shell, MCP, or network there; the flag still applies in every other mode, and `--denyTools` still wins everywhere.
- Made `debug start` always ask for approval. Its grant path is the program to debug, which parses like a command, so debugging `cargo test` or `python -m pytest` was auto-approved in auto and debug modes as though it were the check command — contrary to what debug mode documents.
- Denied tool access to well-known credential files (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.kube`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, `.npmrc`, `~/.docker/config.json`, `gh` hosts) and refused the home directory itself as a working directory.
- Wrote API-key files atomically and owner-only from creation, instead of a plain write followed by a permission change.
- Kept the sandbox proxy's Unix sockets in an owner-only directory, masked workspace secret files inside the jail even when absent, and stopped forwarding a GitHub token across redirects during MCP pack installation.
- Told the model that file contents, command output, fetched web pages, and MCP results are data and never instructions.
- MCP servers now receive `CAW_EXTRA_DIRS`, so tools accept paths under directories granted with `--add-dir` instead of rejecting work the agent is allowed to do.
- Only MCP tools a server marks `readOnlyHint` run in parallel; anything that may mutate runs serially.
- `tools/list` results are cached and re-fetched only for a server that reported a change, and `cawki serve` connects its MCP pool once instead of per request.
- MCP servers now come online one at a time instead of all at the end, so a slow or unreachable server no longer holds back every other server's tools. Startup shows connection progress.
- Loaded configuration files that are missing whole sections instead of failing to start.
- Counted CJK text at roughly one token per character, so auto-compact fires on time in Chinese and Japanese conversations.
- Capped NDJSON frames from MCP servers, which could previously grow without bound.
- Applied the handshake and discovery timeouts to HTTP and SSE MCP servers. They were dropped on that transport, so a host that accepted the connection and never replied blocked startup for two minutes rather than eight seconds.
- Serialized background permission writes so two quick approvals cannot drop one another.
- Reported "reloading" rather than "not enabled" for MCP calls made while servers reconnect.
- Stopped a vision downgrade or a `stream_options` retry from consuming one of the network retry attempts, and shared one HTTP connection pool across model rebinds.

## Install

### One-line install

Linux / macOS / Git Bash:

```bash
curl -fsS https://agent.noxcaw.com/install | bash
```

Pin a version:

```bash
curl -fsS https://agent.noxcaw.com/install | bash -s -- v0.1.1
# or
CAW_TAG=v0.1.1 curl -fsS https://agent.noxcaw.com/install | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://agent.noxcaw.com/install.txt | iex
```

Do not use `irm …/install.ps1`: GitHub Pages serves `.ps1` as `application/octet-stream`, and Windows PowerShell 5.1 `irm` cannot treat that as a script. `.txt` is `text/plain`. To fetch the `.ps1` file anyway:

```powershell
iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://agent.noxcaw.com/install.ps1'))
```

The script picks the asset for your OS/ARCH (Linux x64/arm64 or Windows x64/ARM64), checks `SHA256SUMS` from the same Release, and installs into `~/.cawki/bin`. Windows ARM64 prefers the native build and falls back to x64 emulation for older Releases without an ARM64 asset. macOS prebuilt packages are temporarily unavailable. Running the installer again re-downloads and replaces the current file (on Windows it renames a running exe to `.bak` first). The installer writes `~/.cawki/env` and adds a hook in `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` / `.bash_profile` / fish `config.fish`, then `source`s that env. `curl | bash` cannot update the shell you already have open — open a new terminal, or run `source ~/.cawki/env`. Set `CAW_NO_PATH=1` to skip the rc hook.

If Pages is not live yet:

```bash
curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noxrick91/cawki-hub/master/install | bash
```

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noxrick91/cawki-hub/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Website / manual download

Open the homepage, download the latest asset for your platform, put it in `~/.cawki/bin` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cawki\bin\cawki.exe`), and check `SHA256SUMS`. The homepage “this build / all time” counts come from each GitHub Release asset’s `download_count`: one-line install, `cawki upgrade`, and browser downloads all increment it. Fetching the `install` script from Pages does not; `SHA256SUMS` is counted separately (each install downloads the checksum file first). `upgrade --check` only hits the API.

| Platform | Asset |
|----------|--------|
| Linux x86_64 | `cawki-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Linux aarch64 | `cawki-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| Windows x64 | `cawki-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe` |
| Windows ARM64 | `cawki-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` |

Unsupported combos (Linux musl, 32-bit Windows) have no prebuilt — build from source.

### Upgrade after install

A bare command **only checks**; it does not download:

```text
/upgrade
cawki upgrade
cawki upgrade --check
```

Install latest (only when newer than the current binary):

```text
/upgrade now
cawki upgrade now
```

Pin a tag (can install an older build):

```text
/upgrade v0.1.1
cawki upgrade v0.1.1
```

Downloads show bytes and percent, verify SHA256, then run `--version`. A mismatch restores the `.bak`. Default hub is `noxrick91/cawki-hub`. Override with `CAW_GITHUB=owner/name`.

On Windows the installer renames a running `cawki.exe` to `.bak` and then writes the new file. If the rename fails, it writes beside the exe and asks you to close every window. Open a new terminal and run `cawki --version`. If PATH still points at another copy, use `%USERPROFILE%\.cawki\bin\cawki.exe`.

### Uninstall

There is no separate uninstaller. Delete the install directory; that also removes config, keys, and MCP packs:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cawki
```

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $HOME\.cawki
```

Then clean PATH by hand: on Linux / macOS remove the `# >>> cawki >>>` … `# <<< cawki <<<` block from `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` / `.bash_profile` / fish `config.fish`; on Windows remove `%USERPROFILE%\.cawki\bin` from the user PATH. Per-project `.cawki/` folders are left alone.

### Install from source

The source repo is not public. Developers with access, in the private `cawki` repo:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh          # cargo install → ~/.cawki/bin
cargo run -p cawki -- --workdir .
```

**Linux build deps:** `pkg-config`, `libxcb1-dev`, `libxrandr-dev` (X11 screenshots). Wayland screenshots prefer `grim`; computer-use prefers `ydotool`.

**Windows:** MSVC. Native Windows has **no** exec OS jail — use WSL2 for sandboxed `run`.

**macOS:** screenshot / computer-use need Screen Recording and Accessibility; `cliclick` is recommended.

---

## Quick start

```bash
cawki --workdir .
# short
cawki -w .
```

The first visit to a workspace that has not finished onboarding opens a wizard: pick a theme, confirm the workspace. Change the theme later with `/theme`.

Configure a model (any one):

```text
/model add openai
/model key openai sk-...

/model add anthropic
/model key anthropic sk-ant-...

/model add ollama
```

Or env vars: `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `CAW_API_KEY`. Local Ollama models **do not** need an API key.

Without a cloud key you can still try the demo heuristics (`read Cargo.toml`, `grep fn `, `git status`).

With several models, `/router` sends simple turns to fast and harder work to default / strong. `/help` lists every slash command.

## CLI

```text
cawki [options] [--print prompt…]
cawki upgrade [--check] [now|latest|vX.Y.Z]
cawki rewind
cawki serve [--listen 127.0.0.1:4150] [--token TOKEN] [--workdir DIR]
```

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `-w, --workdir` | Workspace root (default: current directory) |
| `--add-dir` | Extra work directory (repeatable) |
| `--no-mcp` | Do not auto-start MCP |
| `--base-url` / `CAW_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible API |
| `--model` / `CAW_MODEL` | Model id |
| `--api-key` / `CAW_API_KEY` | Key for this process |
| `-c, --continue` | Resume the last session in this workspace (skips the crash prompt) |
| `-r, --resume <id>` | Resume by full UUID or unique prefix (skips the crash prompt) |
| `--permission-mode` | `default` \| `acceptEdits` \| `plan` \| `auto` \| `bypassPermissions` |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Enter full access |
| `-p, --print` | No TUI; assistant reply on stdout |
| `--output-format` | `text` (default) \| `json` \| `stream-json` |
| `--on-approval` | Permission prompt: `fail` (default, exit 2) \| `deny` \| `allow` |
| `--on-ask` | `AskUserQuestion`: `fail` \| `skip` \| `first` \| `all` |
| `--on-plan` | `ExitPlanMode`: `fail` \| `approve` \| `revise` |
| `--allowed-tools` / `--allowed-tools-file` | Tool globs auto-approved in `--print` |
| `--deny-tools` | Tool globs always denied |
| `--max-turns` | Max LLM rounds in `--print` |
| `-V, --version` | Print `cawki x.y.z` |

`--print` defaults to permission mode **auto** so unattended runs are not stuck on every write. Pass `--permission-mode default` when you want the gate. Network, screen, and MCP still fail closed unless `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.

```bash
cawki --print -w . "summarize this repo"
cawki --print --output-format stream-json --on-approval deny -w . "list public API"
cawki --print --on-ask first --on-plan approve -w . "propose a plan then implement"
cawki --print --continue -w . "keep going"
```

`--print` writes the session under `.cawki/sessions/` (including token totals for `/cost`) and prints a resume id on stderr. Ctrl+C / SIGTERM save first, then exit 130. `--continue` errors if this workspace has no stored session.

### `cawki serve`

Local REST / SSE control plane, default `http://127.0.0.1:4150`. A non-loopback listen requires `--token` or `CAW_SERVE_TOKEN` (`Authorization: Bearer …`).

| Path | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `GET /v1/health` | Liveness |
| `GET /v1/models` | Configured providers and router |
| `GET /v1/sessions` | Session list |
| `POST /v1/sessions` | New session |
| `GET /v1/sessions/{id}` | Session summary |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/prompt` | Submit a prompt (`{"prompt":"…","stream":true}` for SSE) |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/cancel` | Cancel the in-flight turn |

`--on-approval` / `--on-ask` / `--on-plan` match `--print`. Permission prompts fail closed when nobody is there.

/plan [task]             enter plan mode; with a task, start that plan (/plan off leaves)
/debug                   debugger session
/init                    detect the stack and write CAW.md
/skills · /skill <name>  skills
/mcp                     MCP packs (list / install NAME)
/plugin enable|disable   plugins
/worktrees               Task worktree list
/todos [expand|collapse|id] task list · click a row or `/todos <id>` for detail
/agents · /tasks         subagents and background tasks · click a row for detail
/exit                    save and quit (exit / quit work too)
```

Saying quit, leave, or goodbye in any language in chat makes the agent call `exit` — same as `/exit`. To pause without closing the app, use `/pause`.

After an unclean exit (kill, power loss, panic), the next launch asks **continue the last session** or **start a new one**. Choosing continue restores the chat and open todos, then the agent resumes that work immediately. A normal quit or closing the Windows console saves first and clears the lock, so the prompt does not appear. `--continue` / `--resume` restore immediately.

Cycle permission modes with **Shift+Tab** (or **Alt+M** / **Alt+Shift+M**): default → accept edits → plan → auto → full access.

Tasks and agents share a row above the prompt: side by side when both are open and the terminal is wide, stacked when it is narrow. Click a row for that item's detail; click `▾` / `▸` on a title to fold that panel. `Tab` moves keyboard focus between the composer, tasks, and agents; `↑↓` scrolls the focused panel; `← →` switches main / subagent when agents have focus; `Esc` returns to the composer.

---

## Models and keys

The default provider is `openai` → `https://api.openai.com/v1` (`gpt-5.6`).

```text
/model                         open the menu
/model list                    list and key status
/model <name>                  switch a saved provider
/model add openai              official GPT (aliases gpt / chatgpt)
/model add anthropic           native Messages API
/model add deepseek            also qwen, qwen-intl, glm, glm-coding, ollama
/model add myapi https://…/v1 mid    third-party / OpenAI-compatible gateway
/model key openai sk-...       write ~/.cawki/secrets.json (all workspaces)
/model key <provider> clear
/model url https://.../v1
/model name gpt-4o-mini
/model env CAW_API_KEY
/model remove ollama
```

In the menu: Enter switches, → manages, Esc / ← goes back.

### Third-party / OpenAI-compatible gateways

NewAPI, OneAPI, and other “OpenAI-compatible” relays should be a **separate named provider**. Do not rewrite `openai` / `anthropic` preset URLs. Copy three things from the gateway console:

| Field | Where to get it |
|-------|-----------------|
| Base URL | OpenAI-compatible root, usually ending in `/v1` |
| Key | The `sk-…` the gateway issued — not an official Anthropic / OpenAI key |
| Model id | Whatever the provider lists (for example, `gpt-4o` or a provider-prefixed id) |

```text
/model add relay https://your-gateway.example/v1 gpt-4o
/model key relay sk-...
```

Gateway traffic uses `/v1/chat/completions`. The native Messages protocol is used only with its official endpoint; pointing a saved profile at a gateway automatically selects the compatible API. Add OpenRouter with `/model add openrouter` and use `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

**Native Messages:** `/v1/messages` is used only with the official endpoint; every other address uses the compatible API. `/chat/completions` gateways are supported, and keys can be configured through an environment variable or `/model key`.

Lookup order (active provider): env (`api_key_env` for that provider — OpenRouter is `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; `CAW_API_KEY` is a last resort) → optional project `.cawki/secrets.json` → **`~/.cawki/secrets.json`** → inline key in config. When `use_keyring` is true (the global default), the OS keyring is tried first. If the keyring backend is not durable, the key stays in `secrets.json` instead of being wiped by an in-memory mock.

Optional: `OPENAI_ORG_ID`, `OPENAI_PROJECT_ID`.

**Ollama:** after `/model add ollama`, pick a pulled model in the menu. **No API key.** An empty `config.json` does not block startup.

**Router:** `/router on` picks fast / default / strong from turn complexity. Classifier: `heuristic` (rules), `llm` (a short extra call), or `hybrid`. `/router pin` freezes the current `/model`. Set a tier with `/router fast|default|strong [provider] [model]`.

---

## Workspace and home

Each project has its own `.cawki/`; cross-project data lives in `~/.cawki/`.

### `~/.cawki/`

| Path | Use |
|------|-----|
| `config.json` | Global defaults (e.g. theme for new workspaces) |
| `secrets.json` | API keys (`/model key` writes here) |
| `rules/*.md` | Global rules you write |
| `memory/` | Global auto memory (OS / toolchain pitfalls) |
| `hf/` | Default download dir for the `hf` tool |
| `skills/` | Skill overrides (default skills are baked into the binary) |
| `tools/` | Portable installs and winget `--location` |
| `bin/` | Released binaries and shims (prepended to `run` / debug PATH) |
| `downloads/` | Default dir for `download_file` |
| `scoop/` | Isolated Scoop root on Windows |
| `mcp/` | Installed MCP packs |
| `languages.toml` | Extra stack / LSP / debug maps (still the built-in `analyze` / `lsp` / `debug` tools) |

### Project `.cawki/`

| Path | Use |
|------|-----|
| `config.json` | Model, permissions, MCP, `last_session_id`, memory flags |
| `secrets.json` | Optional project key override (do not commit) |
| `memory/` | Project auto memory |
| `sessions/` | Sessions |
| `runtime.lock` | TUI-running marker; used to offer restore after a crash |
| `exports/` | Redacted `/export` transcripts |
| `checkpoints/` | `/rewind` file snapshots |
| `audit.log` | Tool allow/deny audit |
| `input_history.json` | Prompt history |
| `rules/*.md` | Project rules |
| `worktrees/` | Isolated trees for `Task worktree: true` |
| `media/` | Screenshot output (still inside the jail) |
| `plan.md` | Plan-mode draft |
| `languages.toml` | Per-repo language detection overlay (wins over the global file) |

Write project notes in `CAW.md` at the workspace root. Workspace MCP servers may go in `.mcp.json`, but repository config can launch local processes and is not loaded by default; use `/settings mcp-workspace` only after you trust the repository. Add long-tail languages in `languages.toml` — do not install one MCP per language.

`/cd` switches workspace mid-session: saves the old session, loads config / skills / trusted MCP for the new root, rebinds the file jail, and opens a new session id (on-screen chat text stays). You cannot switch during a turn or a permission prompt.

---

## Permissions and sandbox

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `default` | Reads may auto-allow; write / exec / MCP / network / screenshot ask |
| `acceptEdits` | File writes and safe filesystem commands auto-pass; MCP / network / other `run` still ask |
| `plan` | Research only. After writing `.cawki/plan.md`, `ExitPlanMode`; architecture plans include diagrams; approve to implement in auto (or ask first). Plan itself is not the startup default |
| `auto` | accept-edits + `analyze` / check-test-lint + git **read-only checks**. Mutating git, bare `make`, network, screen, MCP, and installs still ask |
| `bypassPermissions` (UI: **full access**) | Skip every prompt (including screenshots). Leaving full access clears session grants |

Hard denies (`permissions.deny`, `/settings deny exec:rm *`) apply in every mode, including full access. `/settings clear-grants` clears grants and deny rules.

The first time you enter full access, it confirms and writes `"allow_bypass": true`.

**Full access only skips prompts. It does not turn off the OS jail.**

Permission sheet: `1` / Enter once · `2` this session · `3` write to config · Esc deny.

### File jail

`read_file` / `write_file` / `delete_file` / `list_dir` / `glob` / `grep` / `apply_patch` must land inside the canonicalized workspace. Escaping through intermediate symlinks is denied. `delete_file` only deletes files. `.ipynb` is edited as a cell view.

### OS jail for `run`

| System | Backend | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Linux / WSL2 | bubblewrap + proxy bridge | Needs `bwrap` + `socat`. Blocks `*.exe` / `/mnt/...` |
| macOS | Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) | Built in. Denies `~/.ssh` |
| Native Windows | **Unavailable** (fail closed) | Default `sandbox: false`; use WSL2 |

Defaults: jail **on** (except Windows), exec network **off**, timeout 120s. `/settings sandbox` turns the jail off. Every sandboxed `run` that fails attaches `<sandbox_violations>`. `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` is a one-shot escape (`/settings unsandbox`).

Hard blocks include fork-bombs, `rm -rf /`, piping into a shell, and reading or writing `.cawki/secrets.json` / `config.json`.

### Dedicated LSP jail

Language servers persist per workspace and server id, but use a separate OS-jail policy: network is denied and workspace source is read-only by default, while only `.cawki/lsp/<server>/` is writable. Toolchain/package caches are read-only; SSH, cloud credentials, keyrings, and Cawki secrets stay hidden. Changing policy or shutting down terminates the complete server process tree, and the LSP message queue is bounded.

A server defined by project `.cawki/languages.toml` is repository-controlled executable code. Before every new process, Cawki previews the resolved program, arguments, isolation policy, and configuration fingerprint and requires **Start server / Cancel**. Auto, Full access, and remembered grants cannot bypass this boundary. A command or configuration change produces a new fingerprint.

Use `/settings lsp-sandbox` for the jail, `/settings lsp-writes` for full-workspace writes, and `/settings lsp-network` for host networking. Changing any option first stops running servers. Native Windows still has no OS jail, so WSL2 is recommended; workspace-defined servers still require confirmation.

## Sessions, memory, and export

| Layer | Path | Who writes | Use |
|-------|------|------------|-----|
| Global rules | `~/.cawki/rules/*.md` | you | Fixed notes for every workspace |
| Global memory | `~/.cawki/memory/` | agent + you | Machine-level pitfalls across repos |
| Project rules | `CAW.md` | you | This repo |
| Project memory | `.cawki/memory/` | agent + you | Architecture, build commands, quirks |
| Session handoff | session JSON `handoff` | `/pause` or a tool | Where you left off |

After a failed recovery with no memory write, the turn end nags once. Two failures in the same turn without reading memory interrupt and ask you to open the index / `debugging.md` first. Idle loops trip a breaker: after the same error enough times, `run` / edit / install stop and you get continue / change approach / change model.

`/dream` consolidates memory with the current LLM. It also runs when `auto_dream_enabled` and writes since the last dream ≥ `auto_dream_min_writes`.

`/cost` reads persisted tokens; resuming a session **does not** reset spend. `/export md|json` writes a redacted transcript and does not change the on-disk session file. Auto-compact prefers `prompt_tokens` from the API, otherwise chars/4.

`/rewind` or **Esc Esc** on an empty prompt opens checkpoints: restore code, chat, or both. It does not undo `run` / MCP / hand edits — use git for those.

If background tasks or unfinished todos are still open, the first `/exit`, Ctrl+C, or in-chat `exit` asks you to confirm.

## Tools

| Tool | Meaning | Permission |
|------|---------|------------|
| File read/write / glob / grep / apply_patch | Workspace jail | Read may auto; write asks |
| `run` | Command at the workspace root | Exec + optional OS jail |
| `analyze` | Run checks/tests and parse `file:line` (built-in, not MCP) | Exec |
| `lsp` | Language server: hover / definition / references / symbols / diagnostics (built-in) | First query may launch a process and needs Exec; status / shutdown are reads |
| `debug` | gdb / lldb / cdb / pdb / node / dlv / jdb / … (built-in) | Exec |
| `git_*` | status / diff / log / commit / fetch / pull / push / conflicts / stash | Checks are read-only; mutations need Exec. commits do not add third-party attribution. push never uses `--force` |
| `gh` | PR / issue / release / run / `repo_view`; create and comment | No merge / close / `gh api` |
| `hf` | Hugging Face: whoami / download / upload / cache | Download uses network; upload needs Exec. Token: `HF_TOKEN` |
| `db` | sqlite (workspace path) or postgres / mysql (DSN) | Read-only query; `exec` asks. Non-localhost needs an allowlist |
| `docker` | `ps` / images / logs / build / compose | No `--privileged`. Unsandbox if the jail blocks the socket |
| `ssh` | Allowlisted host `exec` / upload / download | New hosts need approval; no `ssh-copy-id` |
| `cloud` | `aws` / `gcloud` / `az` / `kubectl` | Read-only checks auto; mutations ask. No destroy / login |
| `web_search` / `web_fetch` / `download_file` | Search and download | Network; no localhost / private nets |
| `screenshot` / `computer` | Screenshot and mouse/keyboard | Screen. computer-use is **off** by default; `/settings computer-use` |
| `extract_archive` | zip / tar / gz… | Write |
| `install_program` | Auto-detect host package manager; winget/choco/scoop/apt/dnf/pacman/brew/pip/portable | Every install shows Install / Cancel |
| `Task` | Subagent. `worktree: true` jails to `.cawki/worktrees/<id>/` | — |
| `Worktree` | `list` / `merge` / `abandon` | — |
| `exit` | Leave the process when the user says goodbye or asks to quit (parent only) | Auto |

Under `auto`, git is **check-only**: `git_status` / `git_conflicts` / `git status|diff|log|show` / `git stash list|show`. Rebase still goes through `run`.

Screenshots write inside the jail (default `.cawki/media/`). Full-screen capture tries to hide this terminal. macOS uses ScreenCaptureKit, then CoreGraphics.

Computer-use has a machine-level lock, an app allowlist, and hard denies for password managers / banks. For the browser, `/mcp install browser` — do not click the web with `computer`.

## MCP and skills

`.mcp.json` supports stdio or a remote URL (HTTP / SSE):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."] },
    "remote": { "url": "https://example.com/mcp", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer …" } }
  }
}
```

Global installed packs and enabled plugins are user-managed and load normally. A repository's `.mcp.json` is ignored as untrusted by default; enable `/settings mcp-workspace` only for a repository you trust. Turning it off unloads those workspace servers immediately.

MCP tool catalogs are deferred by default: the first request sends only compact server summaries and `tool_search`, not every tool schema. The model searches for the task, loads at most five relevant tools at a time, and reuses them for later requests in that session; the `/mcp` menu still browses the complete catalog. This uses standard function calling and is provider-independent.

Official packs live in the public repo under `mcp/` ([catalog](https://github.com/noxrick91/cawki-hub/tree/master/mcp)): browser, doc, image, ocr, speech, freecad, blender. `/mcp install <name>` downloads from GitHub into `~/.cawki/mcp/<name>/`. Any GitHub pack works: `/mcp install owner/repo` or a repo URL. Workspace `./mcp/<name>`, a folder, or a zip still work. Installs switch from a validated staging directory and preserve the old version on failure. Heavy Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` are not installed implicitly; call the pack's `*_install_deps` tool on demand after it connects. After `/mcp install browser`, use `mcp__browser__*`.

Attached audio is only a path — it is **not** transcribed automatically. Use the speech pack when the user asks.

Default skills are baked in: `review`, `fix`, `commit`, `doctor`, `verify`, `code-review`, `simplify`, `batch`, `pr`. Override with `~/.cawki/skills/` or workspace `skills/`. `/mcp install` copies that pack’s skills into global skills (stamped `.mcp-pack`). Uninstall removes the pack directory, registry entry, and stamped skills; it does not remove global Python dependencies or external Blender/FreeCAD-style add-ons.

## UI and shortcuts

Multi-tab: each tab has its own turn and queue. `ctrl+t` new tab, `ctrl+tab` switch, `ctrl+w` close. A background tab that finished is marked `•`.

Above the prompt: **tasks / agents**. It appears when there are todos or subagents. Side by side and equal height when both are expanded and the terminal is wide; stacked and content-sized when it is narrow. Click a row for detail (`how` / accept / last check, or the subagent transcript). Click `▾` / `▸` to fold one side. Todos follow document order, top to bottom; agents are newest-first (`main` pinned at the top).

`Tab` cycles keyboard focus across the composer and any expanded tasks / agents panel. With a panel focused, `↑↓` scrolls it and `← →` switches main / sub. Click a tasks or agents row (or `/todos <id>`) for that item's how / accept / last check or live transcript. `/todos expand|collapse` folds tasks. The wheel scrolls the panel under the pointer; `Alt+↑↓` still scrolls the focused region. `/worktrees` manages isolated trees.

While busy, Enter **queues** and does not interrupt. Esc: clear the draft first; if empty and busy, cancel. **Ctrl+C** quits (confirms if background tasks are running). **Ctrl+Shift+C** copies a dragged transcript selection.

`@` opens the file picker. A long paste collapses to `[Pasted text #N]`. The composer grows to about 8 rows, then scrolls with the wheel, `Shift+↑↓`, or `Shift+PgUp/PgDn` (caret and queue stay put). Drafts cap at 4000 characters. `PageUp` / `PageDown` page the transcript.

## Config snippets

Common keys in `.cawki/config.json`:

```json
{
  "auto_memory_enabled": true,
  "auto_dream_enabled": true,
  "auto_dream_min_writes": 3,
  "auto_compact_enabled": true,
  "compact_token_threshold": 80000,
  "cost_limit_usd": 5.0,
  "notify_on_idle": false,
  "permissions": {
    "lsp": {
      "sandbox": true,
      "allow_network": false,
      "allow_workspace_writes": false
    }
  },
  "router": {
    "enabled": false,
    "classifier": "heuristic",
    "fast": { "provider": "ollama", "model": "qwen2.5-coder:7b" }
  }
}
```

`languages.toml` example (`~/.cawki/` or project `.cawki/`):

The global file is user-managed. A project file's `commands` trigger a fingerprinted launch confirmation whenever Cawki creates a server process.

```toml
[[stack]]
name = "Acme"
manifests = ["acme.lock"]
check = "acme check"
test = "acme test"

[[lsp]]
id = "acme"
extensions = ["acme"]
commands = [["acme-lsp", "--stdio"]]

[[debug]]
backend = "native"
extensions = ["acme"]
```

`/settings notify-on-idle` or `/notify on`: desktop toast when a background tab finishes or `--print` completes (off by default).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to do |
|---------|------------|
| Upgrade HTTP 404 | That tag has no Release yet, or the private repo has not pushed artifacts to the hub. See [Releases](https://github.com/noxrick91/cawki-hub/releases) |
| No asset for this platform | The matrix is only the targets in the table above |
| GitHub 403 / 429 | Set `GH_TOKEN` or `CAW_GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| SHA256 mismatch | Download again; do not mix sums and binaries from different tags |
| `--version` mismatch | The installer tries to restore the `.bak` |
| Native Windows `run` sandbox fails | Expected; use WSL2 or `/settings sandbox` to turn the jail off |
| macOS screenshot is black / empty | Grant the terminal Screen Recording, then restart the terminal |
| `--print` exit code 2 | Default `fail`: a permission / question / plan needs a human. Change `--on-approval` / `--on-ask` / `--on-plan` |
| Windows `irm …/install.ps1` errors or does nothing | GitHub Pages serves `.ps1` as binary. Use `irm https://agent.noxcaw.com/install.txt \| iex`, or `iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://agent.noxcaw.com/install.ps1'))` |
| Windows TLS / secure channel error | Use Windows PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell 7; the installer forces TLS 1.2 |
| Broken leftover `cawki.exe` blocks reinstall | Close every Cawki window and run the installer again, or delete `%USERPROFILE%\.cawki\bin\cawki.exe` |
| Windows reinstall/update still shows an old version | Older installers handed an existing install to `cawki upgrade now`, which can leave 0.1.6 in place if the exe is locked or the GitHub API fails. Close every window, run `irm https://agent.noxcaw.com/install.txt \| iex` again, then open a new terminal and run `cawki --version`. Use `Get-Command cawki` to make sure PATH is not another old exe |
| Command not found | `source ~/.cawki/env` or open a new terminal; the installer writes an rc hook. On Windows, open a new terminal so the user PATH reloads |
| `serve` refuses to listen | Anything other than `127.0.0.1` / `::1` needs `--token` or `CAW_SERVE_TOKEN` |
| Ollama still asks for a key | Use `/model add ollama`, not an OpenAI-compatible gateway that requires a key |
| Model reports a small context / stays thinking | Raise that model or endpoint's context above the request size reported by the error, or reduce system prompt, tools, and history; restart local services after changing the allocation and verify the effective value |
| Gateway 401 / unknown model | Use the relay’s own base URL, key, and model id; do not rewrite `openai` / `anthropic` presets. See [Models and keys](#/models) |

This manual is the only public usage doc. Implementation notes stay in the private source repo.
